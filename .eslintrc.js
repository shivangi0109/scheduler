// The error "cy is not defined" in ESLint suggests that the cy object, which is provided by Cypress for end-to-end testing, is not recognized in your ESLint configuration.
// To resolve this, you can add the Cypress globals to your ESLint configuration. If you are using ESLint in a JavaScript file (.eslintrc.js), you can add the following configuration:
module.exports = {
  // ... other ESLint configurations ...
  env: {
    // ... other environment configurations ...
    "cypress/globals": true
  },
  plugins: [
    // ... other ESLint plugins ...
    "cypress"
  ],
  // ... other ESLint settings ...
};

// This configuration uses the env property to specify global variables, and "cypress/globals": true adds the Cypress-specific globals. Also, it includes the "cypress" plugin.
// If you are using a different ESLint configuration format (e.g., JSON or YAML), the adjustments may be slightly different, but the key is to include the Cypress globals.
// After making this change, ESLint should recognize the cy object in your Cypress tests.
